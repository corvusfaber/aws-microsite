# AWS Microsite Infrastructure with Terraform

This project sets up the necessary AWS infrastructure for hosting a microsite using Terraform. It includes configurations for various AWS services such as VPC, EC2, S3, RDS, and more.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (version 0.12 or later)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

Additionally, you need to configure your AWS credentials. You can do this by running:

```bash
aws configure
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-microsite-terraform.git
   cd aws-microsite-terraform
   ```

2. **Initialize Terraform**

   Initialize Terraform to install the necessary providers and modules:

   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. **Review and Modify Variables**

   Review the `variables.tf` file and modify the variables as necessary to match your desired configuration. You can also create a `terraform.tfvars` file to specify your variables.

4. **Plan the Infrastructure**

   Generate an execution plan to review the changes that Terraform will apply:

   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. **Apply the Configuration**

   Apply the Terraform configuration to create the AWS infrastructure:

   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

   Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted.

## Infrastructure Components

The Terraform configuration sets up the following AWS resources:

- **VPC**: A Virtual Private Cloud to host the infrastructure.
- **EC2 Instances**: Virtual machines for the web servers.
- **S3 Bucket**: Storage for static assets.
- **RDS**: A Relational Database Service instance for the microsite's database.
- **Security Groups**: Firewall rules to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- **IAM Roles and Policies**: Permissions for various AWS services.

## Cleanup

To destroy the infrastructure and avoid incurring charges, run:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

Confirm the action by typing `yes` when prompted.
